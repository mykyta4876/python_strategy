I've attached new data for job. There are lots of samples here. What I want is a script to process them into a useable form.

Firstly - what they are...

It's data from horse races in the UK, on the Betfair betting exchange. The data is of the race itself - running times, how the race progressed, and so on. 

However, it's in a strange format as you can see. They are downloadable in this format only.

Although you can download like this, you can potentially use the API - https://historicdata.betfair.com/#/apidocs

One issue is you might not be able to access that (as you're in the Ukraine). So. I included the info in text file (attached).

More information also available here

https://github.com/topics/betfair-historical-data

give me python code (betfair.py) that gets me the data in a format that's in CSV form, so ideal for machine learning. All data should be nicely laid out so easy to read and process in ML packages.

I've added the .tar file to Google drive also, but you might not need it.
